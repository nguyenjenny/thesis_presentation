                    <h4>1. Studies do not explore the combined effect of factors</h4>  
                    <p>Studies often look at the individual contribution of each factor on social communication.</p>
                    <h4>2. Correlation between factors are not considered</h4>
                    <p>Since the factors are studied individually, the correlation between factors not taken into account. However, many of these factors are correlated (e.g, IQ and language; Anxiety, RRBs and sensory profile)</p>
                    <h4>3. Different measures of social communication</h4> 
                    <p>In the literature, different measures of and there for constructs of social commuication are being predicted. We need to compare factors using consistent measures.</p>
