Ultimately, by understanding the factors that drive and predict social communication, we hope to me be able to target specific skills or behaviours to create personalized interventions for individuals with ASD.',

Future studies looking to explore determinants of social communication should keep this construct-specific sensitivity in mind and select an appropriate measure that aligns with it.",
